# ChordMania

![sample worksheet](sample.png)

## Background
I'm bad at sightreading music, especially jazz with complicated chords.
There didn't seem to be a good targeted approach to isolate that particular skillset.
ChordMania will generate a worksheet of random complicated chords to help.

## Requirements
[python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/)

But really you'll just have to run the program to find out.

## How to Use
```
python3 -m ChordMania --help
```

Once you've got an .xml file as output, run it through either [Synthesia](https://synthesiagame.com/) or [MoonPiano](https://mp-app.praisethemoon.org/).
